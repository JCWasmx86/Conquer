# Contribute as a programmer

As a programmer, you can help *Conquer* a lot:

1. Cleanup code.
2. Fix [bugs](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/Conquer/labels/bug)
3. Add more documentation
4. Add [enhancements](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/Conquer/labels/enhancement)
5. Continue working on [projects](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/Conquer/projects)
6. Add more tests. (The code coverage is quite low currently)
