### Artists

Replacements for all images in `Conquer/images`, `ConquerFrontend/images` and `ScenarioGenerator/images/CityIcons`  are needed, as the icons from flaticon.com don't match to 100%.

### UI/UX Designers

Currently, the GUI is quite messy and sometimes a bit difficult to use. Improvements and ideas are quite appreciated.

### Anyone else

1. Translations are always welcome!
2. Bug reports in case you find a bug.
3. Feedback is appreciated.
4. Write/enhance a tutorial. (This is especially important)
5. Ideas for new scenarios are always welcome.
