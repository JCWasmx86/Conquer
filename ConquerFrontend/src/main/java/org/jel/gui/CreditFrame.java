				+ "free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>"
				+ "specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>"
				+ "Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>"
				+ "can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>"
				+ "this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>"
				+ "strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>"
				+ "not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>"
				+ "you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>"
				+ "for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>"
				+ "it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>"
				+ "it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>" + "these things.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>"
				+ "distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>"
				+ "rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>"
				+ "you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>"
				+ "or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>"
				+ "you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>"
				+ "code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>"
				+ "complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>"
				+ "with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>"
				+ "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>"
				+ "library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>"
				+ "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>"
				+ "there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>"
				+ "modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>"
				+ "that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>"
				+ "author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>" + "introduced by others.<br>"
				+ "\f<br>" + "  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>"
				+ "any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>"
				+ "effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>"
				+ "restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>"
				+ "any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>"
				+ "consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>"
				+ "ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>"
				+ "General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>"
				+ "is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>"
				+ "this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>"
				+ "libraries into non-free programs.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>"
				+ "a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>"
				+ "combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>"
				+ "General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>"
				+ "entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>"
				+ "Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>" + "the library.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it<br>"
				+ "does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>"
				+ "Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>"
				+ "of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>"
				+ "are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>"
				+ "libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>"
				+ "special circumstances.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>"
				+ "encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>"
				+ "a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>"
				+ "allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>"
				+ "library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>"
				+ "case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>"
				+ "software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>"
				+ "programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>"
				+ "free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>"
				+ "non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>"
				+ "operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>" + "system.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>"
				+ "users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>"
				+ "linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>"
				+ "that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>"
				+ "modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>"
				+ "\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The<br>"
				+ "former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>"
				+ "be combined with the library in order to run.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>"
				+ "   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>"

				+ "  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>"
				+ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>"
				+ "running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>"
				+ "such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>"
				+ "writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>"
				+ "and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>" + "  <br>"
				+ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>"
				+ "complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>"
				+ "you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>"
				+ "appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>"

				+ "warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>" + "Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>"
				+ "and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>" + "fee.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>"
				+ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>"
				+ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>"
				+ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>"
				+ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>"
				+ "    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>"
				+ "    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>"
				+ "    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>"
				+ "    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>"
				+ "    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>"
				+ "    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>"
				+ "    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>"
				+ "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>"
				+ "    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>"
				+ "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>"
				+ "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>"
				+ "    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>"
				+ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>"
				+ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>"
				+ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>"
				+ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>"
				+ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>"
				+ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>"
				+ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>" + "it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>"
				+ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>"
				+ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>"
				+ "collective works based on the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>"
				+ "with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>"
				+ "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>"
				+ "the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>"
				+ "License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>"
				+ "this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>"
				+ "that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>"
				+ "instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>"
				+ "ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>"

				+ "  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>"
				+ "the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>"
				+ "derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>"
				+ "under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>"
				+ "it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>"

				+ "medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>"
				+ "source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>"
				+ "distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>"
				+ "compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>"
				+ "Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>"
				+ "linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a<br>"
				+ "work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>"
				+ "therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library<br>"
				+ "creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>"
				+ "contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>"
				+ "Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file<br>"
				+ "that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>"
				+ "derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>"
				+ "Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>"
				+ "linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>"
				+ "threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>"
				+ "structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>"
				+ "functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>"
				+ "file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>"
				+ "work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>"
				+ "Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>"
				+ "distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>"
				+ "Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>"
				+ "whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>" + "\f<br>"

				+ "under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>"
				+ "modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>"
				+ "engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>"
				+ "Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>"
				+ "this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>"
				+ "during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>"
				+ "copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>"
				+ "directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>" + "of these things:<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>"
				+ "    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>"
				+ "    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>"
				+ "    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>"
				+ "    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that<br>"
				+ "    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>"
				+ "    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>"
				+ "    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>"
				+ "    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>"
				+ "    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>"
				+ "    to use the modified definitions.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>"
				+ "    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>"
				+ "    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>"
				+ "    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>"
				+ "    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>"
				+ "    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>"
				+ "    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>"
				+ "    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>"
				+ "    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>"
				+ "    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>"
				+ "    specified materials from the same place.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>"
				+ "    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>"
				+ "reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>"
				+ "the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>"
				+ "normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>"
				+ "components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>"
				+ "which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>" + "the executable.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>"
				+ "restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>"
				+ "accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>"
				+ "use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>" + "distribute.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>"
				+ "facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>"
				+ "library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>"
				+ "the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>"
				+ "permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>"
				+ "    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>"
				+ "    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>" + "    Sections above.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>"
				+ "    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>"
				+ "    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>"
				+ "the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>"
				+ "attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>"
				+ "rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>"
				+ "or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>"
				+ "terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>"
				+ "signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>"
				+ "prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>"
				+ "modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>"

				+ "restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>"

				+ "infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>"
				+ "conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>"
				+ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>"
				+ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>"
				+ "distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>"
				+ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>"
				+ "may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>"

				+ "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>"
				+ "particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>"

				+ "impose that choice.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>"
				+ "be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>"
				+ "certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>"
				+ "original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>"
				+ "an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>"

				+ "rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>"
				+ "you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>"

				+ "with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>"
				+ "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>"

				+ "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>"

				+ "    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>"
				+ "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>"

				+ "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>"
				+ "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>"
				+ "    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>"

				+ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>"

				+ "you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>"
				+ "for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>"
				+ "it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>"

				+ "<br>" + "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>"

				+ "rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>"
				+ "you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>"
				+ "or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>"
				+ "you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>"

				+ "complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>"
				+ "with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>"
				+ "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>"
				+ "library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>"
				+ "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>"
				+ "there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>"
				+ "modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>"
				+ "that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>"
				+ "author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>" + "introduced by others.<br>"
				+ "\f<br>" + "  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>"
				+ "any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>"
				+ "effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>"
				+ "restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>"

				+ "consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>"
				+ "ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>"
				+ "General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>"
				+ "is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>"
				+ "this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>"
				+ "libraries into non-free programs.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>"
				+ "a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>"
				+ "combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>"
				+ "General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>"
				+ "entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>"
				+ "Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>" + "the library.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it<br>"
				+ "does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>"
				+ "Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>"
				+ "of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>"
				+ "are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>"
				+ "libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>"
				+ "special circumstances.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>"
				+ "encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>"
				+ "a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>"
				+ "allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>"
				+ "library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>"
				+ "case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>"
				+ "software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>"
				+ "programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>"
				+ "free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>"
				+ "non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>"
				+ "operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>" + "system.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>"
				+ "users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>"
				+ "linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>"
				+ "that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>"

				+ "(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>"
				+ "which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>"
				+ "copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>"
				+ "portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>"
				+ "straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>"
				+ "included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>"
				+ "making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>"
				+ "all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>"
				+ "interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>"
				+ "and installation of the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>"
				+ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>"
				+ "running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>"
				+ "such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>"
				+ "writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>"
				+ "and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>" + "  <br>"
				+ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>"
				+ "complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>"

				+ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>"
				+ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>"
				+ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>"
				+ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>"
				+ "    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>"
				+ "    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>"
				+ "    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>"
				+ "    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>"
				+ "    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>"
				+ "    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>"
				+ "    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>"
				+ "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>"
				+ "    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>"
				+ "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>"
				+ "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>"
				+ "    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>"
				+ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>"
				+ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>"
				+ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>"
				+ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>"
				+ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>"
				+ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>"
				+ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>" + "it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>"
				+ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>"
				+ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>"
				+ "collective works based on the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>"
				+ "with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>"

				+ "derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>"
				+ "under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>"
				+ "it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>"

				+ "  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>"

				+ "therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library<br>"
				+ "creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>"
				+ "contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>"
				+ "Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file<br>"
				+ "that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>"
				+ "derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>"
				+ "Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>"
				+ "linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>"
				+ "threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>"
				+ "structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>"
				+ "functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>"

				+ "  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>"

				+ "during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>"
				+ "copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>"
				+ "directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>" + "of these things:<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>"

				+ "    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>"
				+ "    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>"
				+ "    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that<br>"
				+ "    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>"
				+ "    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>"
				+ "    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>"
				+ "    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>"
				+ "    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>"
				+ "    to use the modified definitions.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>"
				+ "    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>"
				+ "    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>"
				+ "    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>"
				+ "    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>"
				+ "    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>"
				+ "    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>"
				+ "    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>"
				+ "    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>"
				+ "    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>"
				+ "    specified materials from the same place.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>"
				+ "    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>"
				+ "reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>"
				+ "the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>"
				+ "normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>"
				+ "components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>"
				+ "which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>" + "the executable.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>"
				+ "restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>"
				+ "accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>"
				+ "use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>" + "distribute.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>"
				+ "facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>"
				+ "library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>"
				+ "the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>"
				+ "permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>"
				+ "    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>"
				+ "    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>" + "    Sections above.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>"
				+ "    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>"
				+ "    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>"
				+ "the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>"
				+ "attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>"
				+ "rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>"
				+ "or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>"
				+ "terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>"
				+ "signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>"
				+ "prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>"
				+ "modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>"

				+ "infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>"
				+ "conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>"
				+ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>"
				+ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>"
				+ "distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>"
				+ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>"
				+ "may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>"

				+ "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>"
				+ "particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>"

				+ "impose that choice.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>"
				+ "be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>"
				+ "certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>"

				+ "  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>"

				+ "other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<br>" + "your libraries, too.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>"
				+ "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>"
				+ "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>"
				+ "this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>"
				+ "if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>"
				+ "in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>"
				+ "anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>"
				+ "These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>"
				+ "you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>"
				+ "or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>"
				+ "you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>"
				+ "code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>"
				+ "complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>"
				+ "with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>"
				+ "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>"
				+ "the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>"
				+ "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>"
				+ "that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>"
				+ "library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>"
				+ "want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>"
				+ "version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>"
				+ "the original authors' reputations.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>"
				+ "patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>"
				+ "software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>"
				+ "transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<br>"
				+ "we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>"
				+ "free use or not licensed at all.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>"
				+ "GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<br>"
				+ "license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>"
				+ "designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>"
				+ "one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>"
				+ "the same as in the ordinary license.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>"
				+ "they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>"
				+ "program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<br>"
				+ "changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>"
				+ "analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<br>"
				+ "a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>"
				+ "derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>"
				+ "treats it as such.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>"
				+ "Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>"
				+ "sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<br>"
				+ "concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>"
				+ "users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>"
				+ "libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<br>"
				+ "permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>"
				+ "preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>"
				+ "libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<br>"
				+ "this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>"
				+ "changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<br>"
				+ "will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>"
				+ "modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>"
				+ "\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The<br>"
				+ "former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>"
				+ "works together with the library.<br>" + "<br>"

				+ "General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>"
				+ "   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>"
				+ "contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>"
				+ "party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>"
				+ "General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is<br>"
				+ "addressed as \"you\".<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>"
				+ "prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>"
				+ "(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>"
				+ "which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>"
				+ "copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>"
				+ "portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>"
				+ "straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>"
				+ "included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>"
				+ "making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>"
				+ "all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>"
				+ "interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>"
				+ "and installation of the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>"
				+ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>"
				+ "running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>"
				+ "such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>"
				+ "writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>"
				+ "and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>" + "  <br>"
				+ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>"
				+ "complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>"
				+ "you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>"
				+ "appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>"
				+ "all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>"
				+ "warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>" + "Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>"
				+ "and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>" + "fee.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>"
				+ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>"
				+ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>"
				+ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>"
				+ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>"
				+ "    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>"
				+ "    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>"
				+ "    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>"
				+ "    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>"
				+ "    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>"
				+ "    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>"
				+ "    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>"
				+ "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>"
				+ "    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>"
				+ "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>"
				+ "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>"
				+ "    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>"
				+ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>"
				+ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>"
				+ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>"
				+ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>"
				+ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>"
				+ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>"
				+ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>" + "it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>"
				+ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>"
				+ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>"
				+ "collective works based on the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>"
				+ "with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>"
				+ "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>"
				+ "the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>"
				+ "License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>"
				+ "this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>"
				+ "that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>"
				+ "instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>"
				+ "ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>"
				+ "that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>" + "these notices.<br>"
				+ "\f<br>" + "  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>"
				+ "that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>"
				+ "subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>"
				+ "the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>"
				+ "derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>"
				+ "under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>"
				+ "it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>"
				+ "must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>"
				+ "medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>"
				+ "source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>"
				+ "distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>"
				+ "compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>"
				+ "Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>"
				+ "linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a<br>"
				+ "work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>"
				+ "therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library<br>"
				+ "creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>"
				+ "contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>"
				+ "Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file<br>"
				+ "that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>"
				+ "derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>"
				+ "Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>"
				+ "linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>"
				+ "threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>"
				+ "structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>"
				+ "functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>"
				+ "file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>"
				+ "work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>"
				+ "Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>"
				+ "distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>"
				+ "Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>"
				+ "whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>"
				+ "link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a<br>"
				+ "work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>"
				+ "under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>"
				+ "modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>"
				+ "engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>"
				+ "Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>"
				+ "this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>"
				+ "during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>"
				+ "copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>"
				+ "directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>" + "of these things:<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>"
				+ "    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>"
				+ "    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>"
				+ "    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>"
				+ "    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that<br>"
				+ "    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>"
				+ "    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>"
				+ "    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>"
				+ "    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>"
				+ "    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>"
				+ "    to use the modified definitions.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>"
				+ "    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>"
				+ "    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>"
				+ "    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>"
				+ "    specified materials from the same place.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>"
				+ "    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>"
				+ "reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>"
				+ "the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>"
				+ "distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>"
				+ "components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>"
				+ "which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>" + "the executable.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>"
				+ "restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>"
				+ "accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>"
				+ "use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>" + "distribute.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>"
				+ "facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>"
				+ "library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>"
				+ "the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>"
				+ "permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>"
				+ "    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>"
				+ "    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>" + "    Sections above.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>"
				+ "    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>"
				+ "    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>"
				+ "the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>"
				+ "attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>"
				+ "rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>"
				+ "or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>"
				+ "terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>"
				+ "signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>"
				+ "prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>"
				+ "modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>"
				+ "all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>"
				+ "the Library or works based on it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>"
				+ "original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>"
				+ "subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>"
				+ "restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>"
				+ "You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>" + "this License.<br>"
				+ "\f<br>" + "  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>"
				+ "infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>"
				+ "conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>"
				+ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>"
				+ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>"
				+ "distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>"
				+ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>"
				+ "may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>"
				+ "license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>"
				+ "all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>"
				+ "the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>"
				+ "refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>"
				+ "particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>"
				+ "and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>"
				+ "patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>"
				+ "such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>"
				+ "integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>"
				+ "implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>"
				+ "generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>"
				+ "through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>"
				+ "system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>"
				+ "to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>"
				+ "impose that choice.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>"
				+ "be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>"
				+ "certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>"
				+ "original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>"
				+ "an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>"
				+ "so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>"
				+ "excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>"
				+ "written in the body of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>"
				+ "versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>"
				+ "Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>"
				+ "but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>"
				+ "specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>"
				+ "\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and<br>"
				+ "conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>"

				+ "license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>"
				+ "the Free Software Foundation.<br>" + "\f<br>"

				+ "copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>"
				+ "Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>"
				+ "decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>"
				+ "of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>"
				+ "and reuse of software generally.<br>" + "<br>" + "			    NO WARRANTY<br>" + "<br>"

				+ "Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>"
				+ "can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>"
				+ "this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>"
				+ "strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>"
				+ "not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>"
				+ "you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>"
				+ "for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>"
				+ "it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>"
				+ "it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>" + "these things.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>"
				+ "distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>"
				+ "rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>"
				+ "you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>"
				+ "or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>"
				+ "you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>"
				+ "code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>"
				+ "complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>"
				+ "with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>"
				+ "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>"
				+ "library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>"
				+ "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>"
				+ "there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>"
				+ "modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>"
				+ "that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>"
				+ "author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>" + "introduced by others.<br>"
				+ "\f<br>" + "  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>"
				+ "any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>"
				+ "effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>"
				+ "restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>"
				+ "any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>"
				+ "consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>"
				+ "ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>"
				+ "General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>"
				+ "is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>"
				+ "this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>"
				+ "libraries into non-free programs.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>"
				+ "a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>"
				+ "combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>"
				+ "General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>"
				+ "entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>"
				+ "Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>" + "the library.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it<br>"
				+ "does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>"
				+ "Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>"
				+ "of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>"
				+ "are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>"
				+ "libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>"
				+ "special circumstances.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>"
				+ "encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>"
				+ "a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>"
				+ "allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>"
				+ "library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>"
				+ "case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>"
				+ "software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>"
				+ "programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>"
				+ "free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>"
				+ "non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>"
				+ "operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>" + "system.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>"
				+ "users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>"
				+ "linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>"
				+ "that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>"
				+ "modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>"
				+ "\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The<br>"
				+ "former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>"

				+ "other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>"
				+ "this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").<br>"

				+ "  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>"
				+ "prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>"
				+ "(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>"
				+ "which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>"
				+ "copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>"
				+ "portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>"
				+ "straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>"
				+ "included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>"
				+ "making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>"
				+ "all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>"
				+ "interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>"
				+ "and installation of the library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>"
				+ "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>"
				+ "running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>"
				+ "such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>"
				+ "writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>"
				+ "and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>" + "  <br>"
				+ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>"
				+ "complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>"
				+ "you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>"
				+ "appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>"
				+ "all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>"
				+ "warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>" + "Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>"
				+ "and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>" + "fee.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>"
				+ "of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>"
				+ "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>"
				+ "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>"
				+ "    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>"
				+ "    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>"
				+ "    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>"
				+ "    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>"
				+ "    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>"
				+ "    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>"
				+ "    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>"
				+ "    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>"
				+ "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>"
				+ "    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>"
				+ "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>"
				+ "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>"
				+ "    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>"
				+ "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>"
				+ "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>"
				+ "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>"
				+ "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>"
				+ "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>"
				+ "on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>"
				+ "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>"
				+ "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>" + "it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>"
				+ "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>"
				+ "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>"
				+ "collective works based on the Library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>"
				+ "with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>"
				+ "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>"
				+ "the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>"
				+ "License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>"
				+ "this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>"
				+ "that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>"
				+ "instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>"
				+ "ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>"
				+ "that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>" + "these notices.<br>"
				+ "\f<br>" + "  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>"
				+ "that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>"
				+ "subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>"
				+ "the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>"
				+ "derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>"
				+ "under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>"
				+ "it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>"
				+ "must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>"
				+ "medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>"
				+ "source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>"
				+ "distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>"
				+ "compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>"
				+ "Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>"
				+ "linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a<br>"
				+ "work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>"
				+ "therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library<br>"
				+ "creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>"
				+ "contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>"
				+ "Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file<br>"
				+ "that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>"
				+ "derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>"
				+ "Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>"
				+ "linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>"
				+ "threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>"
				+ "structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>"
				+ "functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>"
				+ "file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>"
				+ "work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>"
				+ "Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>"
				+ "distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>"
				+ "Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>"
				+ "whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>"
				+ "link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a<br>"
				+ "work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>"
				+ "under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>"
				+ "modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>"
				+ "engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>"
				+ "Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>"
				+ "this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>"
				+ "during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>"
				+ "copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>"
				+ "directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>" + "of these things:<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>"
				+ "    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>"
				+ "    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>"
				+ "    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>"
				+ "    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that<br>"
				+ "    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>"
				+ "    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>"
				+ "    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>"
				+ "    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>"
				+ "    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>"
				+ "    to use the modified definitions.)<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>"
				+ "    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>"
				+ "    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>"
				+ "    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>"
				+ "    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>"
				+ "    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>"
				+ "    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>"
				+ "    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>"
				+ "    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>"
				+ "    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>"
				+ "    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>"
				+ "    specified materials from the same place.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>"
				+ "    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the<br>"
				+ "Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>"
				+ "reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>"
				+ "the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>"
				+ "normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>"
				+ "components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>"
				+ "which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>" + "the executable.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>"
				+ "restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>"
				+ "accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>"
				+ "use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>" + "distribute.<br>" + "\f<br>"
				+ "  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>"
				+ "facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>"
				+ "library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>"
				+ "the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>"
				+ "permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>"
				+ "    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>"
				+ "    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>" + "    Sections above.<br>"
				+ "<br>" + "    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>"
				+ "    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>"
				+ "    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>"
				+ "the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>"
				+ "attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>"
				+ "rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>"
				+ "or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>"
				+ "terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>"
				+ "signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>"
				+ "distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>"
				+ "prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>"
				+ "modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>"
				+ "all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>"
				+ "the Library or works based on it.<br>" + "<br>"
				+ "  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>"
				+ "Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>"

				+ "conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>"
				+ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>"
				+ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>"
