Tutorial.introductionTitle=Introduction
Tutorial.introduction=Welcome to Conquer\! You are the proud leader of a clan! Manage your resources! Move your troops! Conquer the cities of your enemies! \n\
			Will you fail and get defeated or will you lead your clan to endless glory and wealth?
Tutorial.movingSoldiersTitle=Move soldiers
Tutorial.movingSoldiers=If you press on one of your cities, you will see all reachable cities blinking. With <ESC> you can unselect the city. If you click on one of the \
			blinking cities, you will get a dialog. Enter the amount of soldiers to move and press enter. \nNow the soldiers will be moved to the city. Either will they \
			attack the city if it is not your city or they will help the soldiers in the city. Every move costs coins, depending on the distance and the number of soldiers.
Tutorial.coinsTitle=Coins
Tutorial.coins=A lot of actions require coins:\n\t \
			- recruiting soldiers\n\t \
			- moving soldiers\n\t \
			- upgrading soldiers\n\t \
			- upgrading resource production and defense\n \
			Coins are produced by every person in a city every round. Every soldier uses a certain amount of coins every round.
Tutorial.defenseTitle=Defense
Tutorial.defense=Every city has two defense values:\n\t \
			- The so called \"base defense\". This is an upgradable value. It describes how many soldiers are at least needed to conquer this city. \n\t \
			- The defense bonus is a immutable value that improves the strength of the defensive power. \n\t    If the defense bonus is 1.37 and there are 100 soldiers in the city, these 100 soldiers have the same strength as 137 soldiers with a defense bonus of 1.\n \
			In order to survive, you must upgrade the defense of a city. This can be done in the \"City Info\" tab.
Tutorial.resourcesTitle=Resources
Tutorial.resources=Resources are one core concept of the game. Every round, every person produces a certain amount of every resource and every soldier uses some. \n \
			There are 9 resources: Wheat, fish, wood, coal, meat, iron, textile, leather and stone.\nIron, wood and stone are required to recruit soldiers. \
			The production can be upgraded in the \"City Info\" tab.
Tutorial.relationshipsTitle=Relationships
Tutorial.relationships=Conquer has a relationship-system. If you have a good relation to another clan, you may not be attacked by this clan. If you have a bad relationship, you may soon be attacked. \n \
			The relationship is measured in points from 0 to 100. More points mean a better relationship.\n \
			You can see your relationship to other clans in the \"Relationships\" tab.
Tutorial.soldierUpgradesTitle=Soldier upgrades
Tutorial.soldierUpgrades=You can upgrade soldiers in order to strengthen them. There are three upgradable categories:\n\t \
			- Soldiers power: This power strengthens every soldier in every situation (While attacking or defending a city). \n\t \
			- Defense power: Upgrading this value only improves the soldiers when they are defending a city. \n\t \
			- Offense power: Like the defense power, but only has an effect, if the soldiers of your clan are attacking. \n \
			Upgrading soldiers is essential, as otherwise you will need more soldiers that cost more coins and resources, while the other clans are simply stronger than you with less soldiers.\n \
			This can be done in the \"Clan Info\" tab.
Tutorial.giftsTitle=Gifts
Tutorial.gifts=Gifts are the way to improve your relationship to other clans. You can give coins and resources.\n \
				You can create a gift in the \"Relationships\" tab: \n \
				Select the amount of resources and coins you want to gift, select a clan and press the button. The clan may reject your gift. In this case, your relationship won\'t change.
Tutorial.attacksTitle=Attacks
Tutorial.attacks=In the following the maths behind attacks will be explained.\n \
					The clan A attacks a city of clan D. First, the strength of each army is calculated: \n\t \
					- The strength of the attacker is the amount of soldiers multiplied with the offense power and the soldiers power. \n\t \
					- The strength of the defender is the base defense of the city plus the amount of soldiers multiplied with the soldiers power, defense power and the defense bonus of the city.\n \
					As you can see, the defending army has some advantages. After this values were calculated, they are subtracted from each other. (attacker-defender).\n \
					If the result is positive, the city was conquered and the surviving attackers are now in the city.
