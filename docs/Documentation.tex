\section{Conquer - Programming documentation}
\subsection{Embedding}
\textit{Conquer} was designed without any GUI in mind. It can run headless and can for example run on a server, or with a GUI made with Swing or JavaFX.
\begin{minted}{java}
XMLReader xmlReader = XMLReader.getInstance();
GlobalContext gc = xmlReader.readInfo();
List<InstalledScenario> scenarios = gc.getInstalledMaps();
Initializer.INSTANCE().initialize(null);
for (InstalledScenario scenario : scenarios) {
	ConquerInfo conquerInstance = ctx.loadInfo(scenario);
	conquerInstance.addContext(gc);
	conquerInstance.init();
	while (!conquerInstance.onlyOneClanAlive()) {
		conquerInstance.executeActions();
	}
}
\end{minted}
This sample code initializes Conquer and plays every installed scenario, until only one clan is alive.\newline
What does each line do?\newline
\begin{minted}{java}
XMLReader xmlReader = XMLReader.getInstance();
\end{minted}
Obtains the singleton-instance for the class \texttt{XMLReader}. It has just one method \texttt{readInfo} that returns the \texttt{GlobalContext} (This means: Installed scenarios,
installed plugins and strategies).
\begin{minted}{java}
Initializer.INSTANCE().initialize(null);
\end{minted}
This line initializes the engine. It may for example update the system properties with properties from a file. \texttt{null} can be a \texttt{Consumer<Exception>} that will be called if an exception 
occurs.
\begin{minted}{java}
ConquerInfo conquerInstance = ctx.loadInfo(scenario);
\end{minted}
Construct the game from the specified scenario.
\begin{minted}{java}
conquerInstance.addContext(context);
\end{minted}
\texttt{addContext} binds the \texttt{GlobalContext} read by \texttt{XMLReader} to \texttt{conquerInstance}.
\begin{minted}{java}
conquerInstance.init();
\end{minted}
\texttt{init} does the final initialization like initializing plugins and binding strategies to clans.
\begin{minted}{java}
conquerInstance.executeActions()
\end{minted}
\texttt{executeActions} is an umbrella for executing plugins, letting the computer play, produce resources and all other things.\newline

The lists returned by \texttt{xmlReader.readInfo()} are mutable, so you are able to add own plugins or strategies as an embedder.\newline
If you want to write an own implementation for the engine of Conquer, you just have to implement \texttt{ConquerInfo}.

\subsection{Plugin API}
A plugin has a lifecycle consisting of four parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Instantiation} Every plugin should have a default constructor (No arguments). It is instantiated with reflection. If you want to do something only one time, write it into a static initializer. \textbf{Will only be called once while the JVM is running!}
	\item \textbf{Initialization} In this part, \texttt{init(PluginInterface)} will be called. In this method it is allowed to register callback functions. 
	\item \textbf{Round} Every round, the method \texttt{handle(Graph<City>,Context)} will be called. It is undefined, when it is invoked (Before anything else or at the end of the round).
	\item \textbf{Exit} In this part, \texttt{exit(Result)} will be called. Use this method for cleanup (Closing file descriptors, streams, write data,...).
	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Callbacks}
\paragraph{\texttt{AttackHook}s} are called when an attack is executed. The interface has two methods: \texttt{before(City,City,long)} and \texttt{after(City,City,long,AttackResult}). The first one will
be called as soon as the number of soldiers are determined. The latter one after the attack was executed, clan changes were made and soldiers killed. It contains the result as \texttt{AttackResult}.
\paragraph{\texttt{MessageListener}s} are called as soon as a message was added to or removed from the EventList. It allows you to react to a huge number of different events like changed relationships, random events and anything else.
\paragraph{\texttt{MoneyHook}s} will be called after every city generated the coins and all cities did generated them.
\paragraph{\texttt{MoveHook}s} are executed when soldiers are moved. (Between cities of the same clan).  
\paragraph{\texttt{RecruitHook}s} allow you to get notified when soldiers are recruited.
\paragraph{\texttt{ResourceHook}s} are executed for each city after resources were produced.\newline

If you combine this callbacks, you are able to access the state of the game nearly every time it changes.
\subsection{Strategy API}
\subsubsection{\texttt{StrategyProvider}}
Only an instance of \texttt{StrategyProvider} is instantiated initially. It must have a default constructor, otherwise it instantiation may fail. \texttt{StrategyProvider} has two important methods:
\begin{minted}{java}
Strategy buildStrategy();
\end{minted}
This method returns a new \texttt{Strategy} object that will be used by a clan. A different object has to be returned every time this method is invoked, otherwise some weird things may happen.
\begin{minted}{java}
byte getId();
\end{minted}
This returns an unique, non-negative identifier for this strategy. If two StrategyProviders return the same identifier, the used strategy is undefined.
\subsubsection{\texttt{Strategy}}
\texttt{Strategy} has three important methods:
\begin{minted}{java}
void applyStrategy(Clan clan, Graph<City> cities, StrategyObject obj);
\end{minted}
This method is called every round. \texttt{clan} is the clan for which the strategy should play. \texttt{cities} are all cities in the scenario and  \texttt{obj} is responsible for executing
actions like attacks or upgrades.
\begin{minted}{java}
boolean acceptGift(IClan sourceClan, IClan destinationClan,
			Gift gift, double oldValue,
			DoubleConsumer newValue,
			StrategyObject strategyObject);
\end{minted}
This method is called when one clan wants to give a gift to the clan of the strategy. If the strategy accepts the gift, \texttt{newValue} has to be called with the new relationship value. For example, if the relationship
was at 50 points and after that it should be 57.5, run \texttt{newValue.accept(57.5);} instead of \texttt{newValue.accept(7.5);}. Furthermore \texttt{true} has to be returned if the gift was accepted.
If the strategy rejected the gift, \texttt{false} has to be returned and \texttt{newValue::accept} mustn't be called.

\begin{minted}{java}
StrategyData getData();
\end{minted}
This returns an optional wrapper for everything the strategy needs as storage. This method may return null.
\subsubsection{\texttt{StrategyData}}
This is an optional piece of data that may be used for holding all required values. This interface only provides one method:
\begin{minted}{java}
void update(int currentRound);
\end{minted}
This method is called after the clan for the parent \texttt{Strategy} played.

\subsection{Messages}
Messages can be seen like an event. You can add a \texttt{MessageListener} and get notified as soon as any message was fired. This can be used for example to listen for attacks, troop movements or random events.
\texttt{Message} has several important methods:
\begin{minted}{java}
String getMessageText();
\end{minted}
This should return a (preferably localized) string with the formatted text. This text may be used for showing it in e.g. an event log.
\begin{minted}{java}
boolean isBadForPlayer();
\end{minted}
Only used for showing, e.g. a bad message for the player is in red, while a good one is in green.
\begin{minted}{java}
boolean isPlayerInvolved();
\end{minted}
Allows to sort out the unrelated und for the player useless news.
\begin{minted}{java}
boolean shouldBeShownToThePlayer();
\end{minted}
Allows to sort out messages that are either debug messages or information that would give the player an unfair advantage.

\section{Conquer - Interfaces}

In order to make compatibility between different engines possible, a 
set of interfaces with specified behavior is required.
In the following:
If an clan id is out of bounds, it means, it is either negative or
bigger equals the number of clans. (Zero-based indexing)
\subsection{ConquerInfo}

\subsubsection{\texttt{void addContext(GlobalContext)}}
A conforming implementation shall throw an \texttt{IllegalArgumentException}, if the context is \texttt{null}.
Furthermore an \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown if the list
of plugins, strategies or installed maps is \texttt{null}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{int currentRound()}}
This method shall only return a non-negative integer.

\subsubsection{\texttt{void exit(Result)}}
A conforming implementation must throw an \texttt{IllegalArgumentException},
if the result is \texttt{null}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{Image getBackground()}}
This method may return \texttt{null}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{IClan getClan(int)}}
An \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown, if the given
id is out of bounds.

\subsubsection{\texttt{List<String> getClanNames()}}
This method should return an unmodifiable list of clan names, sorted by
ascending id.

\subsubsection{\texttt{List<IClan> getClans()}}
This method must return the original list of clans, so modifications are mirrored at the internal state.

\subsubsection{\texttt{List<Double> getCoins()}}
This method should return an unmodifiable list of coins every clan has, sorted by
ascending id.

\subsubsection{\texttt{List<Color> getColors()}}
This method should return an unmodifiable list of color an clan is associated with, sorted by
ascending id.

\subsubsection{\texttt{List<Plugin> getPlugins()}}
This method shall return the original non-null list of plugins in no specified order.

\subsubsection{\texttt{ConquerSaver getSaver(String)}}

An \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown, if the given
string is either \texttt{null} or \texttt{string.isEmpty()} is true.

\subsubsection{\texttt{boolean isDead(IClan)}}
An \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown, if \texttt{null} is passed.
This method is the preferred overloaded version to the raw \texttt{boolean isDead(int)}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{boolean isDead(int)}}
Returns \texttt{true} if the clan with the given id is dead (=Has no cities).
An \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown, if the given clan id is out of bounds.

\subsubsection{\texttt{long maximumNumberOfSoldiersToRecruit(IClan,long)}}
Returns the maximum number of soldiers that could be recruited in a clan. This value may never be \texttt{null}.
An \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown if the given clan is either \texttt{null} or the given long is negative.
This is the preferred overloaded version to \texttt{long maximumNumberOfSoldiersToRecruit(int,long)}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{long maximumNumberOfSoldiersToRecruit(int,long)}}
An \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} shall be thrown if the given clan id is out of bounds or the long argument is negative.
A negative value shall not be returned.

\subsubsection{\texttt{void setPlayerGiftCallback(PlayerGiftCallback)}}
The argument shall never be \texttt{null}.
If it is \texttt{null}, an \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} has to be thrown.

\subsubsection{\texttt{void upgradeDefenseFully(ICity)}}
The given city must be \texttt{null}.
Otherwise an \texttt{IllegalArgumentException} must be thrown.
